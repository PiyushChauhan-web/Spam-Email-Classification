# Spam Email Classification

This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The goal is to create an efficient and accurate classifier that can help users filter unwanted emails automatically.

## Overview
Spam email classification is a critical task in email filtering systems to ensure users only receive relevant messages in their inboxes. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify emails.

## Features
- Preprocessing email data, including text cleaning and tokenization.
- Support for multiple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Easy-to-use scripts for training, testing, and deploying the model.

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset, such as the Email Spam Collection dataset.
(https://github.com/AkshaanAngral/Spam_Mail_Prediction/blob/main/mail_data.csv) 
The dataset contains labeled examples of spam and ham emails.

### Dataset Structure
- **Text**: The email content.
- **Label**: Classification as `spam` or `ham`.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PiyushChauhan-web/Spam-Email-Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-email-classification
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input data/emails.csv --output data/processed_emails.csv
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data data/processed_emails.csv --model models/spam_classifier.pkl
   ```

3. Test the model:
   ```bash
   python test.py --data data/test_emails.csv --model models/spam_classifier.pkl
   ```

4. Classify new emails:
   ```bash
   python classify.py --model models/spam_classifier.pkl --email "piyushch453@gmail.com"
   ```

## Model Description
The project employs the following steps:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lowercasing, removal of stopwords, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF or bag-of-words.
- **Classification Models**: Training classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or others.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzing the performance of the models using evaluation metrics.

## Results
The trained model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:
- **Accuracy**: 95%
- **Precision**: 94%
- **Recall**: 96%
- **F1 Score**: 95%
